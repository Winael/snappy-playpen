Pre-requisites

Building

snapcraft snap

Note: Takes a very long time to build, even with multiple cores.

Issues

Needs a way to copy the executable in rather than doing a "make install" as mame makefile has no config for that.
Perhaps needs a plugin which does make but copies files into place?

Currently broken due to libGL issue https://trello.com/c/Rwt1nitw/12-libgl-access-in-snaps
